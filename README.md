## Introduction

The *minimum spanning tree* (MST), a graph constructed from a distribution of points, draws lines between pairs of points so that all points are linked in a single skeletal structure that contains no loops and has minimal total edge length. The MST has been used in a broad range of scientific fields such as particle physics, in astronomy and cosmology. Its success in these fields has been driven by its sensitivity to the spatial distribution of points and the patterns within. ``DeMiSTree``, a public ``Python`` package, allows a user to construct the MST in a variety of coordinates systems, including Celestial coordinates used in astronomy. The package enables the MST to be constructed quickly by initially using a *k*-nearest neighbour graph (*k* NN, rather than a matrix of pairwise distances) which is then fed to Kruskal's algorithm to construct the MST. ``DeMiSTree`` enables a user to measure the statistics of the MST and provides classes for binning the MST statistics (into histograms) and plotting the distributions. Applying the MST will enable the inclusion of high-order statistics information from the cosmic web which can provide additional information to improve cosmological parameter constraints. This information has not been fully exploited due to the computational cost of calculating *N*-point statistics. ``DeMiSTree`` was designed to be used in cosmology but could be used in any field which requires extracting non-Gaussian information from point distributions.

## Dependencies

* Python >= 3.7
* `numpy`
* `numba`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `scikit-learn`

For testing you will require `nose` or `pytest`.


## Installation

MiSTree can be installed as follows:

```
pip install demistree [--user]
```
The `--user` is optional and only required if you donâ€™t have write permission. If you
are using a windows machine this may not work, in this case (or as an alternative to pip) clone the repository,

```
git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/demistree.git
cd demistree
```

and install by either running

```
pip install . [--user]
```

or

```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

Similarly, if you would like to work and edit `demistree` you can clone the repository and install an editable version:

```
git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/demistree.git
cd demistree
pip install -e . [--user]
```

From the `demistree` directory you can then test the install using `nose`:

```
python setup.py test
```

or using `pytest`:

```
python -m pytest
```

You should now be able to import the module:

```python
import demistree as dmist
```

## Notes

### Spherical Coordinate Conventions

Spherical coordinates are defined in MiSTree according to two conventions which will be referred
to as the spherical polar coordinates and the celestial coordinates.

1. Spherical polar coordinates: The angular components are given by the parameters `phi`
and `theta`.
  - `phi` is the longitude parameter belonging in the range [0, 360] degrees.
  - `theta` is the latitude parameter belonging in the range [0, 180] degrees where `theta=0` lies at the north pole.
2. Celestial coordinates: The angular components are given by the astronomy parameters Right Ascension (`ra`)
and Declination (`dec`).
  - `ra` is the longitude parameter belonging in the range [0, 360] degrees.
  - `dec` is the latitude parameter belonging in the range [-90, 90] degrees.

To switch between the two conventions simply requires the following (given in degrees):

```
  ra = phi
  dec = 90. - theta
```

All angular coordinates can be provided either in degrees or radians which can be specified
by setting `units` to `degs` for degrees and `rads` for radians.

### Minimum Spanning Tree

#### Ensuring the constructed MST is spanning

In version 1 of MiSTree the minimum spanning tree (MST) was determined from a
k-nearest neighbour graph (kNN). We used this as our input to increase the speed
of the MST construction but this choice can lead to a spanning tree that is not
spanning. In these cases a spanning tree can usually be determined by increasing
the value of `k` to include many more neighbours. This is not an ideal solution
as in certain cases this will still not resolve the issue. In version 2 of MiSTree
we now by default construct this input tree using the Delaunay triangulation. Since
the edges of the MST are by definition members of the Delaunay triangulation it
ensures that the constructed MST is the true MST and not an approximation as was
previously the case. Users of version 1 will still be able to use kNN if they wish
or the can input a tree of their own which perhaps links other properties.
